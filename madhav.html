Ujjayini has been considered as a native ancient city from historical and religious point of view.
This city remained as a district headquarters of Gwalior State.Around 1900, Maharaja Madhavraoji 
Sindhiya Maharaja Gwalior established such a club here.It is said that some English officer had
advised them to establish clubs for their state at the district headquarters and also informed
about their administrative importance.Initially, this club was established in the building under 
the railway overbridge, wherethe executive engineer of the Public Works Department now resides.
After that in the year 1921-22 when it was called by Mr. Aranten Sahib (English)                  
When the Imperial Bank agent was handed over, the then Suba Shri Baburao Panwar circulated the 
order to shift this club to thepresent building and named the land and building in the name of
Madhav Club. In the said building, the work of the club was first entrusted to Dhanadruy Saheb 
Shri Sevaramji of the city, who encouraged and promoted the activities of the club, in those days the 
rules of compulsory help were prevalent in such club houses, in the same city wealthy people, Seth
moneylenders, businessmen and nobles.was also made a member of these clubs. Due to this, the 
financial condition of the club was always better, but in a limited scope, exceptfor the fulfillment 
of the vested interests of the upper class, the task of protecting the public interest was far from 
them. Even in those days, Shri Madhav Club of Ujjain Nagar continued to function as an exception. </p>
